    <h1 class="text-center" id="hero">About us:</h1>
    <p class="text-center" id="aboutText">
      I am Marton Makk the owner of WaterShapes, a qualified professional with
      over 15 year of experience in the field of design, construction and
      maintenance of water features, fish ponds, water walls, reflection pools
      and relating garden and pond lighting solutions. I specialize in
      designing, constructing, repairing and maintaining my designated projects.
      I am a qualified structural landscaper and holder of a contractor licence.
      I am also qualified in restricted electrical work and attended a
      plumbing/urban irrigation study course. Last but not least I am holder of
      a Bachelor of Arts Degree in International Studies/Communication.Me and my
      team is trained and experienced in the mentioned fields and able to offer
      a complete water feature design, construction and maintenance service. I
      am a private contractor and working in conjunction with some of Sydney's
      leading designers and landscape construction companies as well as high end
      residential developers, builders and architecture firms. Reference work
      and industry referrals are available just click on the button below! No
      work is too big or too small, but the area I am focusing is the
      residential and commercial market. I don't specialize in large public
      projects at this stage. A typical residential or commercial projects can
      run anywhere between $200 (i.e. change a small faulty pump) to $250 000
      (i.e. construct a series of water displays in a local RSL club or for a
      residential building complex) Should you have any questions please feel
      free to contact me below. I look forward to hearing from your water
      feature needs.
