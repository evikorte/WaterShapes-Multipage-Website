    <h1 class="text-center" id="hero">About us:</h1>
    <p class="text-center lh-sm" id="aboutText">
      WaterShapes specialises in the field of design, construction and
      maintenance of water features, fish ponds, water walls, reflection pools
      and relating garden and pond lighting solutions.
      <br />
      <br />
      WaterShapes is a private contractor and working in conjunction with
      Sydney's leading designers and landscape construction companies as well as
      high-end residential developers, builders and architecture firms.
      <br />
      <br />
      The business was established by Marton Makk in 2013. Marton's passion for
      water and related structures dates to his childhood. Marton is university
      qualified from Hungary and obtained his trade license in Sydney. He has
      been pursuing a career in creating decorative water structures since 2006.
      <br />
      <br />
      Water features and ponds are complex structures. The success of any
      project relies on the right mix of different trade skills along with good
      project management and client communication. We pride to deliver quality
      water features to our clients, which relies on our enthusiastic team's
      effort. Among others we offer technical skills and high quality
      craftmanship in landscape construction, electrical work, plumbing
      services, waterproofing, custom stainless steel and fiberglass
      fabrication. We supply and install quality filters, pumps, pond lighting
      and custom parts. We also take care and supply delicate water plants and
      freshwater fish.
      <br />
      <br />
      The business is fully licensed, insured and employs qualified tradesmen
      for our client's piece of mind.
      <br />
      <br />
      No work is too big or too small. We are focusing on the residential and
      commercial markets dominantly in the Sydney metropolitan area. Please
      contact for interstate or overseas projects. Our typical residential and
      commercial projects run anywhere between $200 (change a faulty pump) to
      $250 000 (construct a series of water displays in a local RSL club or in a
      residential building complex)
      <br />
      <br />
      We look forward to hearing from your water feature needs.
